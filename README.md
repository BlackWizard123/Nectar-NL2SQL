# Nectar NL2SQL  

A personal project exploring Natural Language → SQL translation, semantic retrieval, and automated database syncing.

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline that converts natural language queries into SQL, validates and executes them, and falls back to semantic search if SQL generation fails. It also includes a background sync service that keeps a Chroma vector database updated with data from PostgreSQL.
